**What I learn today:**
* Randomization [random module]
* Lists
* Nested Lists

**Project1:**
* Treasure Map

**What the program does:**
* There are 3 rows and 3 columns with empty boxes.
* It will put the treasure in any of the column,row position based on user input.
* Example: user give the input 23, then it will put the treasure in 2nd column and 3rd row

**Project2:**
* Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

**What the program does:**
* User will choose a input between rock, paper and scissors.
* Computer will generate a random value from rock, paper and scissors.
* Compare the game's rule each time and print who wins.
* Game Rule:
    - rock and paper = paper wins
    - rock and scissors = rock wins
    - paper and scissors = scissors wins
