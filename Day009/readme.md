# Day 9 of 100 Days of Python

**What I learn today:**
* Dictionary
* Nested Dictionary (list in a dictionary, dictionary in dictionary, dictionary in list)

**Project:**
* Bind Auction

**What the program does:**
* Takes user name and bidding amount as input
* Storing them into an empty dictionary
* A loop will ask the user to give input until user stops
* Then compare the values of each input and prints the highest value with their keys
* e.g. The winner is Suman with a bid of $123
